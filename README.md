# Vascular Signal Visualization

This repository contains MATLAB-generated visualizations of vascular tone and endothelial function signals. The aim is to explore signal morphology, waveform characteristics, and possible patterns related to non-invasive vascular assessment.

## üß™ Purpose

The project is intended for academic and educational purposes, specifically:

- Exploring patterns in vascular pulse signals
- Demonstrating signal preprocessing and filtering techniques using MATLAB
- Visualizing response curves potentially related to endothelial function

## üìÅ Contents

- `figures/`: MATLAB-generated plots (PDF/PNG)
- `scripts/`: MATLAB scripts used to process and visualize the data
- `data/` *(optional)*: Example raw or simulated signal data
